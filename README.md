There are a few problems with the project. 
The main problem we (I did this project with my team) encountered was the ML model (ARIMA) performed much better than the DL (LSTM).
According to our lecturer, this was due to our preprocessing step not being good enough. 
Tons of thanks to my team members:
- Nguyen Minh Nhat
- Dong Dan Hoai
- Vu Nguyen Nang Khanh

About the dataset, we got the data of Bitcoin's price from Yahoo Finance from 10/03/2014 to 03/24/2023.

If you have any ideas/methods on how to improve this project, please feel free to commit changes.
