There are a few problems with the project. 
The main problem we (I did this project with my team) encountered was the ML model (ARIMA) performed much better than the DL (LSTM).
According to our lecturer, this was due to our preprocessing step not being good enough. 
Tons of thanks to my team:
- Nguyen Minh Nhat
- Dong Dan Hoai
- Vu Nguyen Nang Khanh
